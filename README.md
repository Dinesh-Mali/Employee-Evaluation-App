# Employee-Evaluation-App
This app evaluates employee performance data using Machine Learning Algorithms, AutoML and recommends the promotion for better one. 

# Introduction
Main aim of the project is to predict whether an employee should be promoted or not, using Automated Machine Learning Techniques.

# Motivation
The HR Team, stored data of promotion cycle last year, which consists of details of all the employees in the company working last year.
If they have got promoted or not, but every time this process gets delayed due to so many details available for each employee, thus it gets
difficult to compate and decide.

# What is AutoML?
Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) is the process of automating the tasks of applying machine learning to real-world problems.

# Project Flow

1) Data Analysis - Finding out Different relations.

2) Feature Engineering - Processing the data before it feeding to the model.

3) Model Building using ML - Using ML/Dl Algorithms.

4) Model Building using Auto ML.
